ReIndex
========
ReIndex is the open source social network platform created to be used for the new version of [Programmazione.it](http://programmazione.it) developers' community.

development and the staging site can be unreachable or broken.

Some of the supported features are:

- Questions and answers
- Posts and comments
- Versioning
- Peer reviewing
- Tags and synonyms (merging is also supported)
- Badges
- OAuth2 with Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and GitHub authentication
- Markdown
- Syntax highlighting


Composer Installation
---------------------

To install ReIndex, you first need to install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), a Package Manager for
PHP, following those few [steps](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix):

```sh
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

You can run this command to easily access composer from anywhere on your system:

```sh
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Once you have installed Composer, it's easy install EoC Client.

```sh

        "reindex/reindex": "dev-master"
    },
}
```
2. Run the following command in your project root dir:
```sh
composer update
```
