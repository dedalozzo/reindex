     * Cross-site HTTP requests are HTTP requests for resources from a different domain than the domain of the resource
     * making the request.  For instance, a resource loaded from Domain A (http://domaina.example) such as an HTML web
     * page, makes a request for a resource on Domain B (http://domainb.foo), such as an image, using the img element
     * (http://domainb.foo/image.jpg).  This occurs very commonly on the web today â€” pages load a number of resources in
     * a cross-site manner, including CSS stylesheets, images and scripts, and other resources.\n
     * Cross-site HTTP requests initiated from within scripts have been subject to well-known restrictions, for
     * well-understood security reasons.  For example HTTP Requests made using the XMLHttpRequest object were subject to
     * the same-origin policy.  In particular, this meant that a web application using XMLHttpRequest could only make
     * HTTP requests to the domain it was loaded from, and not to other domains.  Developers expressed the desire to
     * safely evolve capabilities such as XMLHttpRequest to make cross-site requests, for better, safer mash-ups within
     * web applications.\n
     * To make possible cross-site AJAX calls, for example from blog.programmazione.it to ajax.programmazione.it, we
     * must set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
