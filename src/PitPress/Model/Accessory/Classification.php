//! @brief This class is used to classify posts.
//! @details Every document belongs from one to five different categories, most commonly known as tags. Each time a post
//! is stored, we must save the associations with its related tags.
//! We can't save the tags' references in the post itself, because we cannot modify the item if one of the associated
//! tags has been deleted, so we must save a new document that stores the association between the post and his tag. To
//! build the relation we must create a so called classification document (an instance of the present class) for each
//! tag related to the post.
